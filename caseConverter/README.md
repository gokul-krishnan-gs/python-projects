# 🐍 Convert camelCase / PascalCase to snake_case in Python

This demonstrates how to convert strings written in **camelCase** or **PascalCase** to **snake_case** using two different Python approaches.

## 📂 Files Included

- `caseConverter.py` – Uses a traditional `for` loop with conditionals.
- `caseConverterusingListCom.py` – Uses Pythonic list comprehension for compactness.

## 🧠 Concept

Many programming languages (like JavaScript or Java) often use `camelCase` or `PascalCase` for variable and function names. However, in Python, the standard naming convention is `snake_case`.

This project converts any camelCase or PascalCase string to Python-style snake_case, which:
- Improves readability
- Follows Python's PEP 8 style guide
- Is useful for tasks like code refactoring, data cleaning, and scripting
