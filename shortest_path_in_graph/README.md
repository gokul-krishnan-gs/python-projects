# 🚀 Dijkstra's Shortest Path Finder in Graph

This is a **command-line based Python project** that allows users to build a **weighted, undirected graph** interactively and calculate the **shortest path** between nodes using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**.

## 🧠 Features

- 📥 Accepts user input to build the graph
- 📊 Calculates shortest distances using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
- 🧭 Returns:
  - Total distance
  - Path as node sequence (e.g., `A -> B -> D`)
- 🔁 Supports:
  - Specific target path (`A` to `F`)
  - All paths from a starting node
- 🚫 Handles invalid inputs gracefully
